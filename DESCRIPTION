Description: This is a repository containing the Input-Output model for Pacific 
    Coast Fisheries (IOPAC), created by Jerry Leonard. This model estimates 
    gross changes in economic contributions and impacts due to changes in 
    fishery harvests, for example from environmental or policy changes.
